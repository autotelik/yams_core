Yet Another Music Service - Core Engine
================

Open source Rails Engine. Install in a host Rails app.

For creating music streaming services, band pages or record stores

#### Installation

In your host Rails app, first add gem 'yams_core' to your Gemfile

```ruby
gem 'yams_core'
```

Then mount the engine to a location of your choice in your app's `config/routes.rb` file.
 
```ruby
   mount YamsCore::Engine, at: "/"
```

Copy over relevant files
 
```sh
bin/rails yams_core:install:migrations
```

Docker needs the context to be the App so for now seems we have to copy over the engine's  Compose file and 
Copy over Dockerfile to root of App - i.e containers have to be built from . in the App context not the engine Context 

#TODO make part of the installer

```sh 
cp /yams_core/docker/docker-compose.yml /mpApp/docker-compose.yml
cp /yams_core/docker/Dockerfile /mpApp/Dockerfile
```
   
### Manual

Clone from github

This application requires:

A host Rails app

- Ruby 2.5
- Rails 5
- Elastic search with Kibana - [Installation instructions](https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/elasticsearch/reference/current/_installation.html) - or see docker section below.
- Sidekiq and Redis

These are already bundled as services, configured to inter operate, in our docker compose setup. 

Elastic search will be available at : `http://localhost:9200`

Kibana will be available at : `http://localhost:5601` 

To manually install Redis locally see  : `https://redis.io/topics/quickstart`

To start them locally, run from the root of the application:

```sh
redis-server

bundle exec sidekiq
```

Some mp3 processing currently requires ffmpeg

For Ubuntu
```
sudo apt install ffmpeg
```

File uploads require imagemagick

For Ubuntu

```sh
sudo apt-get install imagemagick
```

In your cloned project, install the gems

```sh
bundle install
```

### Docker

A Dockerfile and docker-compose file are provided to simplify installation.

The complete stack, for development, can be spun up with a single thor command :

```sh
bundle exec thor yams:docker:dev:up
```

> Elastic Search container may exit first time, with log containing :

```
ERROR: [1] bootstrap checks failed
[1]: max virtual memory areas vm.max_map_count [65530] is too low, increase to at least [262144]
```

>RESOLUTION : Run : `sudo sysctl -w vm.max_map_count=262144`

You can open a bash sh in the container and jump to seed the DB section.
```sh
 docker exec -ti development bash
```
Elastic search will be available at : `http://localhost:9200`

Kibana will be available at : `http://localhost:5601` 

Sidekick configuration, including list of queues to start can found here : `docker/config/sidekiq.yml`

### DB Setup

We use .env to manage configuration, including DB access.

Copy .env.example to .env and edit, supplying your DB credentials. Current config is setup to use postgres.

```ruby
rake db:create
rake db:migrate
```

#### Seed the DB

The admin user is created via db:seed task with password specified in .env

In development seed will also create an artist User

email: 'artist@example.com'
password: 'artist_change_me'
 
 ```ruby
rake db:seed
```

- Login

- Change admin password !

##### Loading Sample Audio Data

Example data can be bulked uploaded from Excel spreadsheet containing details of tracks and covers.

There is a starter pack of my music and images available Free, click the Download button, from this link : 

- https://www.dropbox.com/sh/ofk927xx4f3kvww/AADNZHYVedH7-3eQNVRR10VVa?dl=0

Save the contents to `/tmp` - which is the path hardcoded in the loading spreadsheet : `db/seed/aqwan_tracks.xls`
 
>The development artist user is assigned by default in the spreadsheet, so edit this to assign tracks to a different user.

Run

```ruby
thor yams:db:seed_music
```

This is essentially a wrapper around an Excel import tool for Rails. If you want to load your own, the raw command would be :

```
thor datashift:import:excel -i  db/seed/aqwan_tracks.xls -m Track -c lib/tasks/config/track_import.yaml 
```


### Development

If hosting your own YAMS, you probably first want to change the `front_page` and `about` pages. 

These can be found under : `app/views/pages`

We use mailcatcher but is not present inr Gemfile since it will conflict with your applications gems at some point.

Simply run `gem install mailcatcher` then `mailcatcher` to get started.
